# Rust on AWS Lambda

This repository contains multiple crates that make it possible to run programs written in Rust directly as functions in AWS Lambda, while keeping a low footprint with regards to memory consumption, bundle size, and start-up speed.

## Example

The `start` function will launch a runtime which will listen for messages from the lambda environment, and call a handler function every time the lambda is invoked. This handler function can be async, as the runtime itself is based on top of `futures` and `tokio`.

```rust,no_run
// [dependencies]
// aws_lambda = { git = "https://github.com/srijs/rust-aws-lambda" }
extern crate aws_lambda as lambda;

fn main() {
    // start the runtime, and return a greeting every time we are invoked
    lambda::start(|()| Ok("Hello ∆õ!"))
}
```

## Comparison to other projects

AWS Lambda does not officially support Rust. To enable using Rust with lambda, great projects such as [`rust-crowbar`](https://github.com/ilianaw/rust-crowbar) and [`serverless-rust`](https://github.com/dobrite/serverless-rust) were created. They leverage Rust's C interoperability to "embed" Rust code into lambda supported language runtimes (in this case Python and Node.js respectively).

While this works, there are some distinct downsides:

1. Higher footprint with regards to memory consumption, bundle size, and start-up speed due to the host runtime overhead.
2. Increased monetary cost due to #1.
3. More build complexity.

This project aims to remove all those downsides without adding new ones. It forgoes embedding and instead leverages lambda's official Go support. With Go, lambda runs a standard Linux binary containing a server and then sends it [`gob`-encoded messages](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/) via [rpc](https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/). This project reimplements all that machinery in Rust, using [`rust-gob`](https://github.com/srijs/rust-gob) for `gob` support and a custom [`tokio`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) server runtime. Lambda does not care that the Linux binary it runs is written in Rust rather than Go as long as they behave the same.

This enables:

1. Lower footprint with regards to memory consumption, bundle size, and start-up speed due to no runtime overhead.
2. Lower monetary cost due to #1.
3. No additional build complexity. Building a binary for lambda is as simple as building a Rust binary locally.

Due to the no-overhead method of adding Rust support, projects deployed to lambda using this runtime should match (and might possibly exceed) the performance of a similar project written in Go.
